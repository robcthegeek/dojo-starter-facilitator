# Dojo Rules

## Our Agreement

1. We're all here to learn.
2. Everyone is welcome.
3. The goal is collaborative, _[Deliberate Practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory)_ - not 'winning' or 'finishing'.
4. Trying new things is not only welcome - but _encouraged_.

## The Rules

### 1. We work _together_ (Pairs-or-better)

We all [Pair Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) or [Mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming). This not only creates a collaborative environment - but helps keep things fun and social. If you're here with colleagues - try to pair with someone you don't normally.

### 2. We use [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

Time and time again TDD has been proven to yield better quality code - but in addition, it's a great way to communicate thoughts/ideas to your partner(s).

### 3. Embrace the (growing) pains

If you're finding some bits hard/awkward - they're likely growing pains. Stick with it and try to avoid the desire to rush to the end doing "as you normally would".

### 4. Get focused!

In an increasingly always-on world - close everything else down and focus on the code! üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
