Starter kit for those that facilitate Coding Dojos. Everything you need from tried-and-tested problems, easy-to-clone projects for commonly-used languages, and some advice and guidance on how to facilitate sessions.

## Starter Kits

These are designed to "get people going" as quickly as possible. Skeleton projects that are installed with most-commonly-used* packages for that language.

1. [C#.NET][c#] (running on [.NET 5.0][net5]), with [xUnit.net][xunit].
2. [TypeScript] (running on [Node.js][nodejs]), with [Jest][jest].

> `*` Appreciate this is subjective, your mileage may vary 😉

## Problems / Katas

> 🚧 These are still being organised. More categorisation and guidance on what-katas-are-good-for-what will be coming.

➡ Check the [problems](/problems) folder in the repository.

## Dojo Rules

Naturally, we should try to keep the rules light - this is supposed to be fun after all! However, I ([`@robcthegeek`](https://github.com/robcthegeek)) think there's some bits that are important. YMMV.

**I strongly suggest reviewing these together, each and every Dojo with the group.**

These are added to [Rules](Rules.md) for easy presentation/sharing.
